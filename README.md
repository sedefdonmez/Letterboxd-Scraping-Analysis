How Data Will Be Used?



The data scraped from Letterboxd will be utilized to perform clustering analysis on movies and directors. We plan to:

Clustering Movies: Group movies based on shared attributes such as ratings, genres, and
release years using algorithms like K-means or hierarchical clustering.

Clustering Directors: Analyze directors by clustering them according to their genre preferences,
average ratings of their movies, and other relevant metrics.

Visualization and Analysis: We will use visualization techniques such as scatter plots
to present the clusters. This will help in identifying patterns and relationships within the data.

Insights and Applications: By understanding the clustering, we aim to gain insights into user
preferences and industry trends. These insights can be useful for:

Predictive analysis of director success based on historical data.
Recommender systems to suggest movies to users based on clustered characteristics.
Market analysis for producers and marketers to understand prevailing genres and successful
collaborations.
